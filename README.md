# Basilica

A CMS for medium-sized websites, built on the Django framework, intended to permit (and require) focus on the *structure* of the content, not just the design of the site and the content itself.

## Philosophy and Intent

TODO

## Setup

I recommend you use [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order to create a python environment with the correct dependencies. After you've installed it, run

```
virtualenv <env>
source <env>/bin/activate

pip install django
```

where `<env>` is the name you'd like for your virtual environment.
